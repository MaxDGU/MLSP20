In this project I feed several language networks (LSTM's, RNN's) with jazz chord data to evaluate their effectiveness at predicting the next group of chords (2,4, and 8 beats) in a song. Research project on AI-assisted music making with the Institute for Audio Acoustic Music Research (IRCAM) in Paris. 


Upgraded chord data representations from MLSP19.
