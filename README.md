Language models are increasing in use for AI applications in the music industry. To fully automate musical production, there lie three interesting technical problems: chord prediction, genre classification, and  melody generation. In this project I feed several language networks with jazz chord data to evaluate their effectiveness at predicting the next group of chords in a song. 


Upgraded chord data representations from MLSP19.
